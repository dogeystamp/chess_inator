//! Neural network tools.
//!
//! # Neural net architecture
//!
//! The NNUE has the following layers:
//!
//! * Input (board features)
//! * Hidden layer / accumulator (N neurons)
//! * Output layer (Single neuron)
//!
//! The input layer is a multi-hot binary tensor that represents the board. It is a product of
//! color (2), piece type (6) and piece position (64), giving a total of 768 elements representing
//! for example "is there a _white_, _pawn_ at _e4_?". This information is not enough to represent
//! the board, but is enough for static evaluation purposes. Our NNUE is only expected to run on
//! quiescent positions, and our traditional minmax algorithm will take care of any exchanges, en
//! passant, and other rules that can be mechanically applied.
//!
//! In the engine, the input layer is imaginary. Because of the nature of NNUE (efficiently
//! updatable neural network), we only store the hidden layer's state, and whenever we want to flip
//! a bit in the input layer, we directly add/subtract the corresponding weight from the hidden
//! layer.
//!
//! For more information about training and the neural net architecture itself, consult the `nnue/`
//! directory's README file.
